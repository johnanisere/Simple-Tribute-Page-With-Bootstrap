							Most of what people do well at is what comes easily to them to do. By training, learning, and practice, they improve, excel, and become experts. If what you are doing comes without ease but with pain, tears, struggle, and labour, you may have to reconsider if it is really your calling or vocation.

							Olusegun Obasanjo
							</h1>
							<dt >Early Life<br/></dt>
							<dd >Olusegun Obasanjo was born on 5 May 1937 to his father Amos Adigun Obasanjo Bankole and his mother Ashabi in Abeokuta, Ogun State, 		Nigeria. His mother died in 1958 and his father died in 1959. He became an orphan at the age of 22.In 1948, Obasanjo enrolled into 		Saint David Ebenezer School at Ibogun, for his primary school education. From 1952 to 1957, he attended Baptist Boys High School 		(BBHS), Abeokuta, for his secondary school education.
							</dd>
							<dt >Military career</dt>
							<dd>In 1958, Olusegun Obasanjo joined the Nigerian army. Some of his studies and training includes: Mons Cadet School, Aldershot, 			England; Royal College of Military Engineers, Chatham, England; School of Survey, Newbury, England; Indian Army School of 				Engineering, Poona; Royal College of Defence Studies, London.
							</dd>

							<dt> Federal Commissioner for Works and Housing</dt>
							<dd>In January 1975, General Yakubu Gowon, appointed Obasanjo as the Federal commissioner for works and housing to oversee the 				development of housing, highways, roads, bridges, electrical and street lighting in the country following the oil boom.
							</dd>

							<dt>Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters</dt>
							<dd>In July 1975, General Murtala Mohammed took power as head of state via a military coup, Obasanjo was appointed as the chief of staff supreme headquarters.
							</dd>

							<dt>Military coup of 13 February 1976</dt>
							<dd>On 13 February 1976, coup plotters, led by Army Col. Dimka, marked him, Murtala and other senior military personnel for 				assassination. Murtala was killed during the attempted coup, but Obasanjo escaped death. The low profile security policy adopted 
								Murtala had allowed the plotters easy access to their targets.
							</dd>

							<dt>Head of State</dt>
							<dd><em><mark>Oil Boom-</mark></em>The military regime of Obasanjo benefited from oil revenues that increased. Increased oil revenues permitted government 		spending for infrastructure and improvements on a large scale<br/>

								<em><mark>Industry-</mark></em> The Obasanjo government invested strongly in infrastructure, and the number of "parastatals" — jointly government- and privately owned companies — proliferated.<br/>

								<em><mark>Education-</mark></em> Education also expanded under Obasanjo. At the start of the civil war, there were only five universities, but by 1975 the number had increased to thirteen, with seven more to be established over the next several years. <br/>

								<em><mark>Political repression-</mark></em> Obasanjo was also accused of being responsible for political repression. In one particular instance, the compound of Nigerian musician and political activist Fela Kuti was raided and burned to the ground after a member of his commune was involved in an altercation with military personnel. Fela and his family were beaten and raped and his mother, political activist Funmilayo Ransome Kuti, was killed by being thrown from a window. Her coffin was carried to Obasanjo's barracks as a protest against political repression.<br/>

								<em><mark>Transition to democracy-</mark></em>On 1 October 1979, Obasanjo handed power to Shehu Shagari, a democratically elected civilian president, hence becoming the first military head of state to transfer power peacefully to a civilian regime in Nigeria.<br/>
							</dd>

							<dt>Imprisonment</dt>
							<dd> Obasanjo spoke out against the human rights abuses of the regime, and was imprisoned for alleged participation in an aborted coup based on testimony obtained via torture.</dd>

							<dt>Presidential campaigns and elections</dt>
							<dd>Obasanjo ran on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and defeated Olu Falae</dd>
